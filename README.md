# Remove-Grains-In-Images_FPGA

this project uses a python code (in IMAGE_EXTRACTION folder) to convert image file to bin and then we can use FPGA with verilog code to remove grains from the image.
for sample the image in IMAGE_EXTRACTION is 224*224 but you can change it easily.
you can see the sample image and the result in that folder too.
